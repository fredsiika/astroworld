# Astroworld
**Recreation of the 1979 Atari game Asteroids from scratch using vanilla JavaScript.**

Asteroids is probably the grandfather of arcade games as it is the most influential release and the one the triggered the Golden Age of Arcade Games. Released back in 1979 for the arcade systems, the game was later ported to Atari 2600 due to its popularity. 

The goal of the game is to simply survive for as long as you can while blowing up as many floating space rocks around you and earning some points. When an asteroid is destroyed, it will be broken into smaller pieces that are much harder to hit and avoid.

More improvements on the way.
